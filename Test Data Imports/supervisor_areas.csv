1,123456M,Apps & Educational Games for Children with Disabilities,Touchscreen interfaces and low cost tablets have become somewhat ubiquitous. Such devices are being put more and more to educational use. Educational games for children are a result of these trends.,TRUE,5,Android - Games - Augmented Reality - Learning - Disability,"10"" tablet (or larger)",Mobile development - Web development - UI Design,Ensure wellbeing of subjects 
2,123456M,Multi-Model UI in Semi-Autonomous Motorised Wheelchairs for the Aged and Disabled,Studies have shown that access to a means of independent mobility is important to the aged and disabled. Although many of the latter can manage with traditional manual or powered wheelchairs - a good proportion cannot do so without the assistance of another - able-bodied individual. This has led to research into 'smart wheelchairs - the purpose of which is to enable the user to independently navigate to a known destination. User interfaces (Uls) are particularly challenging given that this particular user group is limited in its capacity to either understand or use complex technologies. Another potential issue with this user group is cost - since its members are often financially disadvantaged. This area of research explores the use of natural language and ubiquitous devices (such as smartphones and tablets) to enable unambiguous and safe wheelchair control using simplified multi-modal Uls.,TRUE,4,Voice Recognition - Mobile Platforms,Required resources should be available free of charge,UI Design - Databases - Mobile Development,Dependent on the project
3,123456M,Improving Human Productivity through Prediction and Automation,Many daily tasks are repetitive and labour intensive. Novel applications that predict user actions can be married to modern user interfaces such as voice and touch screens-to enable users to quickly confirm their intentions (or otherwise) - thus enabling individuals to do things that might otherwise be forgotten-and saving the user much time in the process.,TRUE,2,Automation - Prediction,"A 7"" or 10"" tablet may be required.",Web & Mobile App Programming,None.
4,123456M,Voice Recognition and Mixed Input Application,Although touchscreen devices are generally considered very intuitive and have become mainstream - predominantly due to their use in mobile phones - this mode of input is not always the most efficient or appropriate. In cases where a user is unable to use his hands and/or look directly at the screen for any length of time - voice driven interfaces may be more appropriate and safer. In some cases - the combination of voice - touchscreen - or conventional screen and keyboard input may prove to be a better com bination than the exclusive use of one of these modes of input. This area investigates applications that fall into this category.,TRUE,1,Voice Recognition - Voice UI - Databases - Mobile Platforms,Resources required should be obtainable without charge.,UI Design - Databases - Mobile Development,Dependent on the project.

As computer scientist - we develop different solutions that aim to help carers in their day to day jobs. These solutions are increasingly becoming more pervasive - were carers are using tablet applications to know more about their patients and log more information manually and through wearable devices.

11,123460M,ICT in Smart Wheelchairs,As our society evolves the proportion of ageing citizens is increasing. A significant proportion of this sector is dependent on human care - often in an institutionalized environment. One of the biggest costs is that of the human carers themselves. A large proportion of the carers time is spent tending to individual resident needs - among which is transportation rom one part of a nursing institution to another. Various ICT based solutions are being studied to alleviate this problem - help use the time of human carers more efficiently and improve the quality of life of residents through increased mobility and interaction. his may involve the use of different technologies in the fields of IOTs - multi-modal input - location sensing - Smart Wheelchairs as well as algorithmic approaches to navigation - route finding and behaviour modelling.

24,123468M,Database Data Modelling,Data modelling is the basis with which data requirements - of a computer information system - are met. The more complete the constructed model is - with respect to these requirements - the easier is the system development required Furthermore - it was now become very common that a set of data requirements are met with more than one data model for example using relational tor most requirements and then use specialized spatial data modelling to capture GIS data requirements. Since the relational data model - it has become apparent that the issues are dependent on the chosen data modelling language.

29,123471M,Voynich Word Prediction,The Voynich Manuscript - often called ‘the most mysterious manuscript in the world’ - resides in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University (Manuscript MS 408). Since its purchase from the Jesuit order in 1912 by Wifrid Voynich over a century of efforts to decode its mysterious (and only example of its kind) text has proved unsuccessful. In the last few decades the contents of this mysterious text have been transcribed into a computer readable format. There are some challenges with the transcriptions in that - not surprisingly - there is not 100% consensus as to what some of the text transcribes to (if you view images of the pages - even with a magnifying glass - you can see why) The various versions of the transcriptions encode within them alternative transcriptions for the words in question or other indicators of uncertainty.
